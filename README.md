# XBoard
News Feed Website

A News Feed website is an aggregator which aggregates news content from different websites in one place. It consists of news articles grouped under various topics such as Technology, Politics, Sports etc. In this buildout, we will be fetching news articles for selected topics from the flipboard website and presenting them to the users. Users will be able to browse through the articles and click on the article of interest to go to the URL for that particular article.


Visually, for XBoard, each topic will be represented by an accordion (which is another name for the collapse component of bootstrap) and news articles related to the topic will be represented on a carousel (this is also a bootstrap component) within this accordion. Users can expand or collapse the accordion of the topic theyâ€™re interested in and browse through the news articles using the carousel.


We are required to build our own Crio News Feed website - by using Bootstrap for the frontend and obtaining the rss feed from flipboard.
